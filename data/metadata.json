Erickson argues that there was not sufficient evidence to justify a request by police that he submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT) before his arrest. Erickson also contends that there was not sufficient evidence to support probable cause to arrest him. I reject these arguments and accordingly affirm.2 BACKGROUND \u00b62 City of Monona police cited Erickson with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated in violation of WIS. STAT. \u00a7 346.63(1)(a) and operating with prohibited alcohol concentration in violation of \u00a7 346.63(1)(b). The police also gave Erickson a notice of intent to revoke his operating privileges for allegedly refusing to submit to a chemical test of his breath after his arrest under Wisconsin\u2019s implied consent law. See WIS. STAT. \u00a7 343.305. 2 The City of Monona cross appeals, but I need not address the cross appeal. Explaining further, the City challenges the circuit court\u2019s determination that Erickson was not guilty of operating under the influence of an intoxicant on the ground that there is \u201cno evidence in the record to support a not guilty verdict.\u201d The City states that its cross appeal is \u201cprotective,\u201d by which it means that the cross appeal is intended"

Wedig predicted that Erickson would fail field sobriety tests if subjected to them, and that this would lead to Erickson\u2019s arrest for drunk driving. Erickson took the position that the officers lacked evidence that he had driven on a public roadway, as opposed to the privately owned parking lot. Erickson asked who had called the officers to the scene (despite the fact that the officers had already told him, accurately, that it was the store manager who had called police).

However, the ALJ was simply not persuaded that Joiner sustained a cervical and left shoulder injury from the fall. On reconsideration, the ALJ outlined the basis for his determinations. He noted that there was some delay in reporting any neck injuries and that Dr. Compton had only ordered testing of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Similarly, on appeal, the Board recognized its review of the entire record and that records evidencing neck pain were not noted until 2022. The medical experts for MAC Construction did not -7- assess impairment to the cervical spine.

Dr. Ballard did not assess any impairment for Joiner\u2019s shoulder conditions, and the ALJ was free to accept that as well. There was no challenge or clarification asked of Dr. Kuiper as to whether his 1% impairment was for the right shoulder only, but the ALJ was entitled to make that inference based upon his review of all the evidence. -8- The weighing of the evidence falls within"

The trial court directed a verdict in favor of Laughlin and Poppe Law Firm upon Baker\u2019s third-party claims, but Mulligan\u2019s claims as asserted in the complaint were presented to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Mulligan and found that Baker had committed malpractice. The jury awarded Mulligan damages of $250,000 for pain and suffering caused by Officer -9- O\u2019Daniel\u2019s and Officer Kapanski\u2019s conduct in the underlying action and also awarded additional damages of $250,000 in pain and suffering caused by Baker\u2019s malpractice. As a result, the trial court rendered a Judgment on March 21, 2023, against Baker for a total of $500,000. Baker filed Appeal No. 2023-CA-0707-MR and Mulligan filed Cross- Appeal No. 2023-CA-0740-MR.

First, Fitzpatrick relies on our decision in Gardner v.

Dist., 609 F.3d 392, 403 (6th Cir. 2010). Gifford points to the county\u2019s official policy of placing all detainees into a single temporary- holding cell during the intake and booking process. In essence, he claims that this official policy deprives pretrial detainees like him of their constitutional rights by failing to segregate them by risk during these initial processes. And yet Gifford does not contest that the policy required segregation when a detainee fails to behave appropriately during intake. And though he claims in his affidavit that Brown \u201cappear[ed] to be high on cocaine\u201d such that \u201chis geeked up behavior was obvious to everyone,\u201d Gifford fails to provide evidence of how that behavior alone revealed that Brown posed a risk to others in the temporary holding cell.

Before they could carry out the arrest warrants, Riley came downstairs and peacefully surrendered in the living room. What briefly happened next is central to this appeal. Four officers began a protective sweep of Riley\u2019s bedroom, which they captured on their body cameras. From the base of the stairs, Officer Kevin Kelley announced, \u201cColumbus Police, make yourself known\u201d and ascended to the bedroom with his service weapon drawn. Other officers followed.

The lookback period for Hinojosa started on January 23, 2004\u201415 years before he committed his current offenses on January 23, 2019. See Hinojosa, 67 F.4th at 346. And a state court sentenced Hinojosa for the prior crime at issue in this case in 1994. See id. The court convicted Hinojosa of an assault with the intent to do great bodily harm for shooting a victim in the head. See id. at 343. It sentenced him to an indeterminate prison range with a minimum of 54"

Hinojosa did not receive any credit toward his March 2002 sentence for the eight or so months that he spent in prison after the 2001 assault but before that 2002 sentence. As noted, he instead served that time based on the earlier 1994 sentence. Schnell Tr., R.237, PageID 2200. Without the earlier 1994 sentence, though, Hinojosa would have received this credit.

Here, we are convinced that the district court\u2019s refusal to consider Ibarra\u2019s medical treatment needs in the context of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) did not result in a more severe sentence, because the district court considered the exact same circumstances in the context of Ibarra\u2019s personal history and characteristics.

Id. \u00b6\u00b6 52, 54\u201356 (Page ID #7\u20138). Honestie complied, at which point defendant Anthony Barberino \u201ccommanded Honestie to put her right hand behind her back,\u201d which she did. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 57\u201359 (Page ID #8). \u201cDefendant Barbarino [sic] pulled"

TAYLOR, JUDGE: Derwin Nickelberry, pro se, brings this appeal from a March 24, 2023, order of the Jefferson Circuit Court denying Nickelberry\u2019s Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure (CR) 60.02 motion to vacate his sentence of imprisonment. We affirm. In 2006, Nickelberry was tried by a jury and ultimately found guilty of fifteen counts of first-degree robbery and three counts of theft by unlawful taking over $300. The armed robberies were allegedly carried out by a group of -2- individuals. The Commonwealth introduced the testimony of two such individuals, Tommy Hardin and Jeanine Spicer, at Nickelberry\u2019s trial. The circuit court sentenced Nickelberry to a total of seventy-years\u2019 imprisonment.

As he does here, Joiner asserted in his petition that the ALJ failed to address the impairment for the left shoulder and cervical spine. The ALJ explained his position on both of those contentions, as follows: 2. [Joiner] contends the ALJ failed to address the appropriate impairment for the left shoulder injury. [Joiner\u2019s] Petition in this regard is overruled. Dr. Kuiper assigned a 1% rating for [Joiner\u2019s] shoulders, and while he did not specify to which shoulder the 1% rating applied, a reasonable inference would be the 1% was assigned to [Joiner\u2019s] right shoulder since the injury to that shoulder represented a full thickness rotator cuff tear. Thus, a reasonable inference would be that Dr. Kuiper did not assign an impairment rating for the left shoulder. 3.

However, the ALJ was simply not persuaded that Joiner sustained a cervical and left shoulder injury from the fall. On reconsideration, the ALJ outlined the basis for his determinations. He noted that there was some delay in reporting any neck injuries and that Dr. Compton had only ordered testing of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Similarly, on appeal, the Board recognized its review of the entire record and that records evidencing neck pain were not noted until 2022. The medical experts for MAC Construction did not -7- assess impairment to the cervical spine. The Board found there was evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Joiner did not sustain a cervical injury from the 2020 accident.

These types of challenges rarely succeed. We must defer to the district court\u2019s decision about how the \u00a7 3553(a) factors balance out in each case. See United States v. Drake, 126 F.4th 1242, 1246 (6th Cir. 2025). And because the court chose a sentence within Hinojosa\u2019s guidelines range, we must presume the reasonableness of this sentence. See id. Hinojosa has fallen well short of rebutting this presumption. The district court\u2019s explanation for its sentence reasonably balanced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. On the aggravating side of things, the court found it \u201cdifficult to downplay the seriousness of the offense\u201d because Hinojosa had shot a man merely for arguing with him about drug prices.

Here, we are convinced that the district court\u2019s refusal to consider Ibarra\u2019s medical treatment needs in the context of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) did not result in a more severe sentence, because the district court considered the exact same circumstances in the context of Ibarra\u2019s personal history and characteristics.

It appears that the district court either misunderstood Bland\u2019s argument in favor of reducing his sentence on the conspiracy count or erroneously concluded that it was unable to reduce Bland\u2019s sentence upon consideration of the mandatory 60-month consecutive sentence for the firearm count.

CR 60.02 relief is only available for issues that could not have been raised by direct appeal or RCr 11.42 motion. McQueen v. Commonwealth, 948 S.W.2d 415, 416 (Ky. 1997); Gross v.

Nickelberry contends that the circuit court erred by denying his CR 60.02 motion. He initially claims that the Commonwealth of Kentucky violated Brady, 373 U.S. 83 by failing to disclose exculpatory evidence that would have proved that his co-defendants committed perjury. Nickelberry asserts that the Commonwealth committed fraud by stating that it did not have possession of statements given to police by two of Nickelberry\u2019s co-defendants. -4-"

In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court concluded that no Brady, 373 U.S. 83 violations occurred, which was affirmed on appeal by this Court (Appeal No. 2019-CA-0626-MR). And Nickelberry\u2019s claim of fraud by the Commonwealth lacks sufficient factual basis for this Court to review. We thus reject these contentions of error. Nickelberry also argues that the Commonwealth wrongfully used inadmissible and false evidence to obtain the indictment and his conviction. The admissibility and sufficiency of evidence are issues that should have been raised in a direct appeal or in an RCr 11.42 motion. CR 60.02 relief is not available for issues that could have been raised in a direct appeal or in an RCr 11.42 motion. As to his allegations of false evidence and fraud by the Commonwealth, Nickelberry has failed to demonstrate same beyond mere conclusory allegations that are without sufficient factual bases.

The ALJ found that Ellis Joiner (\u201cJoiner\u201d) sustained a work-related injury at MAC Construction and Excavation (\u201cMAC Construction\u201d) on July 15, 2020 when he fell from a ladder.

As he does here, Joiner asserted in his petition that the ALJ failed to address the impairment for the left shoulder and cervical spine. The ALJ explained his position on both of those contentions, as follows: 2. [Joiner] contends the ALJ failed to address the appropriate impairment for the left shoulder injury. [Joiner\u2019s] Petition in this regard is overruled. Dr. Kuiper assigned a 1% rating for [Joiner\u2019s] shoulders, and while he did not specify to which shoulder the 1% rating applied, a reasonable inference would be the 1% was assigned to [Joiner\u2019s] right shoulder since the injury to that shoulder represented a full thickness rotator cuff tear. Thus, a reasonable inference would be that Dr. Kuiper did not assign an impairment rating for the left shoulder. 3.

However, the ALJ was simply not persuaded that Joiner sustained a cervical and left shoulder injury from the fall. On reconsideration, the ALJ outlined the basis for his determinations. He noted that there was some delay in reporting any neck injuries and that Dr. Compton had only ordered testing of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Similarly, on appeal, the Board recognized its review of the entire record and that records evidencing neck pain were not noted until 2022. The medical experts for MAC Construction did not -7- assess impairment to the cervical spine. The Board found there was evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Joiner did not sustain a cervical injury from the 2020 accident.

Baker\u2019s argument plainly lacks supportive factual detail and sufficient legal analysis. 11 When seeking review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to disqualify legal counsel, the primary method is to file a writ of prohibition/mandamus. See Marcum v. Scorsone, 457 S.W.3d 710, 716-17 (Ky. 2015); Commonwealth v. Maricle, 10 S.W.3d 117, 120-22 (Ky. 1999). -42- Simply put, Baker\u2019s argument is cursory and perfunctory. It is not the function of this Court to research, construct, or articulate a party\u2019s arguments on appeal. Harris v. Commonwealth, 384 S.W.3d 117, 131 (Ky. 2012) (citing Doherty v. City of Chicago, 75 F.3d 318, 324 (7th Cir. 1996)).12 We, thus, perceive no error. We view any remaining contentions of error in Baker\u2019s direct appeal to be moot or without merit. CROSS-APPEAL"

    "chunk_text": "NO. 2023-CA-0740-MR Mulligan alleges that the trial court erroneously granted a directed verdict upon his claim for punitive damages. Mulligan believes that he was entitled to have the jury instructed upon punitive damages based upon Baker\u2019s conduct. Mulligan argues that punitive damages are proper because Baker was grossly negligent in his representation of Mulligan. When viewing the evidence most favorable to him, Mulligan maintains that a reasonable juror could have found that Baker was grossly negligent and that he was entitled to an award of punitive damages. Mulligan cites to evidence adduced at trial, which included that Baker withdrew from representing Mulligan in the underlying action; that Baker failed to research the applicable statute of limitations which led to the dismissal of 12 In the notice of appeal filed in this case, Kirk Laughlin and the Poppe Law Firm were named appellees, based on the directed verdict of Baker\u2019s third-party claim. However, neither party filed an appellee brief as required by the Kentucky Rules of Appellate Procedure (RAP) 30 and 32. Notwithstanding, they improperly addressed this issue in Mulligan\u2019s appellee brief at page 45-47. Given Baker\u2019s failure to articulate a valid argument on appeal, we have declined to impose sanctions"

The Kentucky Supreme Court has recognized that punitive damages may be recovered in a legal malpractice action when the damages are based upon the attorney\u2019s conduct.

To recover punitive damages, it must be demonstrated that \u201cthe attorney was grossly negligent in handling the case and acted with oppression, fraud, or malice.\u201d Id. at 23; see also KRS 411.184(2).

During trial, there was certainly an abundance of evidence showing that Baker\u2019s representation of Mulligan was negligent in the underlying action. Baker admitted that he mistakenly allowed the statute of limitations to expire on all but one"

Nevertheless, we are unable to conclude that the evidence also demonstrated gross negligence, fraud, oppression, or malice committed by -44- Baker. To the contrary, there is insufficient evidence to support this argument. In this respect, we are of the opinion that the trial court properly directed a verdict upon Mulligan\u2019s claim for punitive damages. SUMMARY In Appeal No. 2023-CA-0707-MR, we reverse the March 21, 2023, Judgment as to the award of $250,000 for pain and suffering based upon Baker\u2019s malpractice conduct but affirm the award of $250,000 for pain and suffering endured by Mulligan as the result of the conduct of LMPD officers as asserted in the underlying action, to which Mulligan was entitled but for Baker\u2019s negligence. We also affirm on all other grounds raised by Baker in his direct appeal and by Mulligan in Cross-Appeal No. 2023-CA-0740-MR. ALL CONCUR. BRIEFS FOR APPELLANT/CROSS- APPELLEE: Kenneth H.
